This is a placeholder file. 
Replace this with a real .ico file named 'icon.ico' in this directory to use it as the application icon.

For example:
1. Create a 256x256 PNG icon
2. Convert it to .ico format using a tool like https://convertio.co/png-ico/
3. Place the .ico file in this directory and name it 'icon.ico'
